News+
-----------
Since Google has decided to shutdown Google Reader. We are trying hard to find alternative services. There are a lot of great services that many of you would like to use. That's why we have decided to support them as well. I want to introduce you a new app which is called News+. News+ is developed based on gReader great functional features. It also has an Extension system so that services could be integrated into News+. The extension api will be published and the documentation will be updated soon. You can find it under Github https://github.com/noinnion/newsplus. We hope that many of you could create great Extension for News+.

Right now the app is still in Beta status. We will try to improve it with the time. There are still many bugs ;)

### Usage

You need to install News+ first to use the extensions. You can find the extensions on the Dropdown in the action bar.
